## v0.2.0 ##

Completion (experimental)

Artoo now has an experimental completion command that is based on, and works similarly to the npm completion. For Window users works only by using `git-bash`.

This command will output a Bash script to put into your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile file.

After upgrade run this in the console and then restart the console.

`artoo completion >> ~/.bashrc`
