Artoo-Detoo
===========

### Introduction

Artoo is a tool that will reshape the universe, it will hide you from NSA and Prism and it will bring you an abundance of joy in your life and its **free**.

Actually now, **Artoo** it is just a CLI (command line interface) tool build in Node.JS that has only one goal:

**ACHIEVE THE SWISS ARMY KNIFE STATUS FOR YOUR WORKFLOW**

By using Artoo you will be able to check for errors in sample files, generate random ids or even convert your data file from one format to another. And this is only the beginning.

The name **Artoo** comes from the small robot R2 D2 from the motion picture Star Wars. He was always around at the right time to save everyone or to fix the ship or to hack some door to open. So I guess this tool tries to be the same.

## Installing Artoo ##

To install Artoo you need Node.js and Git, depending on the method, to be installed on your computer and accessible via the terminal window.

### Step 1

Download Node.js from [here](http://nodejs.org/download/) and follow the instructions to install it on your local machine.

Make sure the `Add to path` option is selected. Once the installation is finished you should be able to run `node --version` in your terminal window to see the node version.

#### Proxy settings

Working behind a proxy environment means that all our network connections are through that proxy so everything that needs to be accessed outside of our network will be blocked if you don't set up Node.js package manager, NPM, to use a proxy each time it's accessing the internet.

**NPM** is a Node.js package manager. As its name would imply, you can use it to install node programs. Also, if you use it in development, it makes it easier to specify and link dependencies.

Artoo uses some open source Node.js libraries in order to parse the commands or save the log files and so on so when we install Artoo we will have to install those modules and this is done by NPM.

NPM uses a configuration file and it can be added to via the command line `npm config set ...`

	npm config set HTTP_PROXY http://euuklonisa1.eu.ipsos:8080
	npm config set proxy http://euuklonisa1.eu.ipsos:8080

After you run this in the terminal a `.npmrc` file will be created in your user directory (`c:\Users\your.user\`) that contains this 2 lines:

	HTTP_PROXY = http://euuklonisa1.eu.ipsos:8080
	proxy = http://euuklonisa1.eu.ipsos:8080

When this is done you can proceed with Step 2.

### Step 2 - Git Version (recommended)

To install `Artoo` globally you just need to run:

`npm install git+ssh://git@bitbucket.org:ipsosmori/artoo.git -g`

That is it, after the installation process is done you can run `artoo` in the command line and have fun.

**Note:** Before running this command make sure you have registered to Bitbucket and you have configured a SSH key.

### Step 2 - Non GIT Version

Download the latest version of Artoo from the repository [https://bitbucket.org/ipsosmori/artoo/get/master.zip](https://bitbucket.org/ipsosmori/artoo/get/master.zip "https://bitbucket.org/ipsosmori/artoo/get/master.zip") (you need to be logged in before downloading).

Extract the contents of the zip file and rename the extracted folder to `artoo`.

Open a terminal window inside the `artoo` folder and execute

`npm install ./../artoo -g` - this will install Artoo globally so it can be called from the terminal at any time.

If everything goes ok you will see something like this:

	artoo@0.0.1 C:\Documents and Settings\XPMUser\Application Data\npm\node_modules\artoo
	├── abbrev@1.0.4
	├── colors@0.6.2
	├── semver@1.1.4
	├── nopt@2.0.0
	├── q@0.9.6
	├── lodash@1.0.1
	├── csv@0.3.6
	├── hogan.js@2.0.0
	├── rc@0.3.1 (deep-extend@0.2.6, ini@1.1.0, optimist@0.3.7)
	└── unzip@0.1.7 (setimmediate@1.0.1, readable-stream@1.0.17, match-stream@0.0.1, pullstream@0.4.0, fstream@0.1.24, binary@0.3.0)

Now you can call `artoo` from the terminal to see the help system on how to use it.

# How to update

To update `Artoo` to the latest version just run:

`npm install git+ssh://git@bitbucket.org:ipsosmori/artoo.git -g`

as we did for the installation, this will get the latest version and it will overwrite the existing one.

# How to use

run `artoo` and follow the instructions

# Completion (experimental)

Artoo now has an experimental completion command that is based on, and works similarly to the npm completion. For Window users works only by using `git-bash`.

To make it work you need to run the following command after upgrading Artoo to the newest version.

`artoo completion >> ~/.bashrc`

This command will output a Bash script to put into your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile file.

Restart the console and then you can use:

`artoo conv >> TAB` and it will auto complete to `artoo convert-db`. Cool right?
