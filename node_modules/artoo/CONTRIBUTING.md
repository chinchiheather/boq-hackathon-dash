# Contributing to Artoo

Looking to contribute something to Artoo? **Here's how you can help.**

## Reporting issues

1. **Search for existing issues.** We should avoid duplicate issues, so it will be great if we check first if someone else has reported the same issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix available.
2. **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and version, browser and version. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.
3. **Fork, Fix, Submit** If you can fix it by submitting a pull request even better. Make it so.

## Key branches

- `master` is the latest, deployed version.
- `develop` is the development branch where new stuff are being added and tested.
- `feature/*` is the feature development branch (ex: feature/search-field).
- `hotfix/*` is the issue testing and fixing branch (ex: issue/issue-number-description)

## Pull requests

- Try to submit pull requests against the latest `master` branch for easier merging
- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes--keep them simple and small
- Try to share which browsers your code has been tested in before submitting a pull request

## Coding standards

`.editorconfig` is provided so make use of this also.

### HTML

- Four (4) spaces for indentation, never tabs
- Double quotes only, never single quotes, unless is javascript
- Always use proper indentation
